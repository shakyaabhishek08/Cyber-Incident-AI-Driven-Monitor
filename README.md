# Cyber-Incident-AI-Driven-Monitor
This project is a Cybersecurity News Recommender that combines web scraping, machine learning (TF-IDF + cosine similarity), and a Flask web interface. It automatically scrapes the latest cybersecurity news from Google News, saves it to a CSV file, and recommends the most relevant article based on a user-provided keyword.
